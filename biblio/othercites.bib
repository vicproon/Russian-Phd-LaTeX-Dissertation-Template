  abstract = "We give a new method for direct reconstruction of three-dimensional objects from a few electron micrographs taken at angles which need not exceed a range of 60 degrees. The method works for totally asymmetric objects, and requires little computer time or storage. It is also applicable to X-ray photography, and may greatly reduce the exposure compared to current methods of body-section radiography."

  abstract={Despite major advances in x-ray sources, detector arrays, gantry mechanical design and especially computer performance, one component of computed tomography (CT) scanners has remained virtually constant for the past 25 years—the reconstruction algorithm. Fundamental advances have been made in the solution of inverse problems, especially tomographic reconstruction, but these works have not been translated into clinical and related practice. The reasons are not obvious and seldom discussed. This review seeks to examine the reasons for this discrepancy and provides recommendations on how it can be resolved. We take the example of field of compressive sensing (CS), summarizing this new area of research from the eyes of practical medical physicists and explaining the disconnection between theoretical and application-oriented research. Using a few issues specific to CT, which engineers have addressed in very specific ways, we try to distill the mathematical problem underlying each of these issues with the hope of demonstrating that there are interesting mathematical problems of general importance that can result from in depth analysis of specific issues. We then sketch some unconventional CT-imaging designs that have the potential to impact on CT applications, if the link between applied mathematicians and engineers/physicists were stronger. Finally, we close with some observations on how the link could be strengthened. There is, we believe, an important opportunity to rapidly improve the performance of CT and related tomographic imaging techniques by addressing these issues.}

  abstract = { In this paper we have discussed what appears to be a superior implementation of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART). The method is based on 1) simultaneous application of the error correction terms as computed by ART for all rays in a given projection; 2) longitudinal weighting of the correction terms back-distributed along the rays; and 3) using bilinear elements for discrete approximation to the ray integrals of a continuous image. Since this implementation generates a good reconstruction in only one iteration, it also appears to have a computational advantage over the more traditional implementation of ART. Potential applications of this implementation include image reconstruction in conjunction with ray tracing for ultrasound and microwave tomography in which the curved nature of the rays leads to a non-uniform ray density across the image. }

  abstract={The author investigates how one can estimate the total attenuation, p, of a polyenergetic X-ray beam what the total attenuation, m, of a monoenergetic beam would have been along the same ray. He finds that for beams with typical diagnostic X-ray spectra passing through the human body one can find a simple function f such that f(p) is a sufficiently close estimate of m to allow good reconstructions. He also finds that m cannot be accurately estimated from p based on the assumption that the human body consists of water alone. The author's results are demonstrated by reconstructions of a mathematical model of a cross-section of the human thorax. The article is self-contained and includes in its Appendices a detailed discussion of the mathematical nature of the problem of beam hardening in computed tomography.}
